scikit-learn is the reference library for classical machine learning in Python. It provides a comprehensive toolbox for supervised and unsupervised learning, with well-supported techniques such as linear regression, random forests, support vector machines, k-means clustering, and more. Its consistent API, excellent documentation, and integration with NumPy, SciPy, and pandas make it the go-to library for most machine learning tasks outside of deep learning.
