overrides is a Python decorator that ensures methods in subclasses correctly override methods in parent classes. It helps catch errors like signature mismatches or accidental method duplication at development time, improving code clarity and maintainability. This is particularly useful in object-oriented codebases where explicit overrides help maintain consistency and prevent bugs. While familiar to those with a Java background, it may be less intuitive for developers new to object-oriented programming.
