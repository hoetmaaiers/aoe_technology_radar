Alembic is a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy, providing a structured way to manage and version database schema changes. It supports autogeneration of migrations, making it easier to track and apply schema updates consistently. Alembic is essential for projects using SQLAlchemy, ensuring that database schemas remain in sync across development, testing, and production environments.
