Jenkins is a widely adopted automation server for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). Compared to cloud-based solutions like GitHub Actions or CircleCI, Jenkins offers full control over infrastructure, making it ideal for self-hosted environments. Its extensive plugin ecosystem and active community support a broad range of use cases, from simple pipelines to complex CI/CD workflows.
