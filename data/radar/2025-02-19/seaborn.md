Seaborn is a Python library for creating static visualizations, built on top of Matplotlib. Through the 'grammar of graphic' complex plots can be created with minimal code. While it is a solid option for static plots, we recommend using Plotly for most visualization tasks due to its interactivity and modern aesthetics. Seaborn should only be used when Plotly can't handle specific requirements for static visualizations.
