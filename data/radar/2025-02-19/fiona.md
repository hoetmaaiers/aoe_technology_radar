Fiona is a library for reading and writing vector data, built on top of GDAL. While typically more low-level, it forms the backbone for higher-level libraries like GeoPandas. For most common geospatial tasks, GeoPandas is sufficient, but Fiona can be useful when more control over file formats and advanced I/O operations is required. It remains an essential part of the Python geospatial ecosystem.
