Django is a comprehensive web framework with built-in features like an ORM, authentication, and an admin interface. While powerful, it’s often more than what’s needed for our use cases. FastAPI offers a lighter, more modern alternative for building APIs with better performance and flexibility. Existing Django projects can remain, but for new projects, we recommend using FastAPI.
