numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy arrays. It optimizes performance by leveraging multi-threading and efficient memory usage, making it significantly faster than plain NumPy for large array computations. It is particularly useful for accelerating element-wise operations and complex expressions without changing much code. Ideal for data-intensive tasks where performance matters.
