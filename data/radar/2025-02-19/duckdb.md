DuckDB is an in-process SQL database designed for fast analytical queries on large datasets. Often described as the "SQLite for analytics," it supports columnar storage and works seamlessly with data in Parquet and Arrow formats. While still evolving, DuckDB shows promise for specific tasks like data exploration, lightweight analytics, and working with large tabular datasets in memory. Itâ€™s worth testing in isolated workloads.
