PostGIS is a spatial database extension for PostgreSQL, adding support for geographic objects and geospatial queries. It enables advanced spatial operations like intersections, and distance calculations directly within SQL. Integrating nicely with GeoPandas and QGIS, PostGIS is essential for projects involving spatial data.
