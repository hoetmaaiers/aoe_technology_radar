s3fs is a wrapper around boto3 that provides a more Pythonic, filesystem-like interface for interacting with S3, similar to pathlib. It simplifies common file operations but still depends on boto3 under the hood. While useful, it is being evaluated for broader adoption due to potential limitations in performance and feature completeness.
