Dask scales Python workflows for large datasets and parallel computing. It extends pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for out-of-core and distributed computations. Ideal for handling data that doesnâ€™t fit in memory or for scaling across multiple cores or clusters. Stick with pandas for smaller datasets to keep things simpler.
