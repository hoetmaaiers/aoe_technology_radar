FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs in Python. It is fast, easy to use, and built with type hints for better validation and developer experience. It has strong documentation, automatic OpenAPI generation, and async support, making it well-suited for high-performance applications. With growing adoption and a strong ecosystem, it is the preferred choice for building APIs in Python (over Flask and Django).
