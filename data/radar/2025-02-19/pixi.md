Pixi is a promising new tool that works with both Conda and PyPI registries, ensuring reproducibility with a combination of pyproject.toml and pixi.lock. Dependencies stay up-to-date with pixi add, and its use is spreading organically across the team. However, it cannot build packages yet. There are also concerns about whether it encourages researchers to upgrade dependencies regularlyâ€”something enforced naturally with Conda environments.
