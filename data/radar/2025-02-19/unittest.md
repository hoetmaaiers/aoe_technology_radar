unittest is the built-in testing framework in Python, providing a consistent and reliable way to write tests. However, compared to pytest, it is more verbose and less flexible, with limited features for parameterization and fixture management. Given pytest's superior developer experience, powerful command-line tools, and extensive plugin support, we recommend using pytest for new projects. Existing tests in unittest can be maintained, but new tests should use pytest.
