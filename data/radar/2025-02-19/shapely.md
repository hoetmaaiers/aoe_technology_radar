Shapely is a library for geometric operations and spatial analysis in Python. While more low-level than GeoPandas, it provides the core geometry functions that GeoPandas builds on. In many cases, GeoPandas can handle spatial tasks without direct Shapely usage, in which case you're encourage to avoid using Shapely directly.
