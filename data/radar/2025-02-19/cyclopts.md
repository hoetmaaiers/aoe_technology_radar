Cyclopts is a CLI-building library that addresses some limitations of Typer, particularly with custom types as arguments. It competes with argparse and offers excellent validation along with automatic help generation. While it shows potential, it is still relatively new and not widely adopted as of February 2025. Further evaluation is needed before broader use.
