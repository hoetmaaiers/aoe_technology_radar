Docker is a general-purpose containerization tool that provides a reproducible, isolated environment for managing dependencies. Its learning curve is steep, but we encourage the use of Docker. It should, however, be combined with a dedicated dependency manager (e.g., Conda, Pixi, or uv) inside the container for better package management.
