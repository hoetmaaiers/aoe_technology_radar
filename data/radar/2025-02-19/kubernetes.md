Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform with strong community support and a broad ecosystem. While simple workloads, such as frontends, can already run on our cluster, Kubernetes is not yet production-ready for more complex deployments, especially those involving databases. The platform is still under development. Reach out to Guy Driesen, Koen Dierckx or Augusto Leite Pinto De Carvalho for more context.
