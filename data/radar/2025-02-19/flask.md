Flask is a lightweight web framework for building web applications in Python. While it has been widely used and remains suitable for existing projects, we no longer recommend it for new development. FastAPI offers significant advantages, such as built-in type validation, asynchronous support, and automatic OpenAPI generation. Legacy Flask projects will not be converted to FastAPI, but for new projects, FastAPI is the preferred framework.
