Apptainer (formerly Singularity) is a containerization tool often used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. While it shares similarities with Docker, Apptainer is designed for secure, portable containers. Itâ€™s worth assessing for HPC-specific use cases, but for general containerization, Docker remains the preferred option.
