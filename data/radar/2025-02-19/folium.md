Folium is a Python library for creating interactive maps using Leaflet.js. It makes it easy to visualize geospatial data directly in Python notebooks by rendering interactive web-based maps. This is especially useful in a research context for quick exploration and presentation of spatial data. Folium integrates well with pandas and GeoPandas, allowing for simple mapping of dataframes containing geographic information.
