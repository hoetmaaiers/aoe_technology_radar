boto3 is the official Python SDK for AWS, providing a comprehensive interface to interact with AWS services like S3, EC2, DynamoDB, and more. It supports both high-level resource abstractions and low-level API calls, making it suitable for various tasks ranging from simple operations to complex cloud automation. Given its reliability, active maintenance, and official status, boto3 is the default choice for interacting with AWS in Python projects.
