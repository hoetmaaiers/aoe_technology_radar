mypy is a static type checker for Python that enforces type annotations, helping to catch potential bugs early and improve code maintainability. It is widely used in larger codebases and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines. However, with ruff's type-checking features on the horizon, we are monitoring its development closely. If ruff proves to be a reliable alternative, mypy may eventually become unnecessary for new projects.
