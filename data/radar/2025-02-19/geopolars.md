GeoPolars is an emerging library for geospatial data processing built on top of Polars. It aims to offer performance improvements over GeoPandas but is still under active development. While promising, it currently lacks key features, and GeoPandas remains the more mature and reliable choice. Development is being monitored internally by Lorenz Hambsch.
