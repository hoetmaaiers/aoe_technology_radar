xarray simplifies working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays, offering an intuitive API similar to pandas but for multi-dimensional data. It is particularly useful in domains like geospatial analysis, where multi-band raster images or time-series data are common. xarray integrates well with NumPy, Dask, and Rasterio, making it a powerful tool for handling large datasets with named dimensions and coordinates.
