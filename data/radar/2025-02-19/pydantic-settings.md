pydantic-settings is built on Pydantic for managing typed and validated settings through environment variables and configuration files. It integrates well with Pydantic-based applications and focuses on strict typing, validation and testing. While it overlaps with Dynaconf, itâ€™s better suited for simpler setups. For more complex configurations involving external services or multiple sources, Dynaconf may be a better fit.
