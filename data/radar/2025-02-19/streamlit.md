Streamlit is a fast and easy-to-use framework for building interactive web applications directly from Python scripts. It’s particularly useful in a research context for quickly creating data dashboards, experiment visualization tools, and interactive prototypes without needing frontend expertise. Streamlit supports live updates, integrates well with pandas, matplotlib, and Plotly, and is ideal for sharing results and insights in a more engaging format.

We are currently trialing Streamlit for the Balmatt project, and it’s showing strong promise as a tool for building user-friendly interfaces to explore and visualize data interactively.
