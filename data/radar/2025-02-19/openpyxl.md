openpyxl is the preferred library for reading and writing Excel files in Python, supporting .xlsx and .xlsm formats. It provides a robust feature set for manipulating cell data, styles, formulas, and more. Compared to alternatives like xlrd (deprecated for .xlsx) and xlwt (limited to .xls format), openpyxl is the most reliable and actively maintained choice for working with modern Excel files. Avoid using older libraries like xlrd, xlwt, and pyExcelerator.
