pandas is the standard library for data manipulation in Python. While its syntax can be inconsistent, it has extensive documentation, many online examples, and strong AI tool support. It integrates well with libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and GeoPandas, making it a key part of the Python data ecosystem. Its broad adoption and rich feature set make it the default choice for working with structured data.
