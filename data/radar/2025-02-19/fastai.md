fastai is a high-level library built on top of PyTorch, designed to simplify deep learning model training. It provides pre-built workflows for tasks like image classification and natural language processing, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal effort. However, it abstracts away much of the underlying framework, making it less suitable for custom projects or large-scale production.
fastai is primarily recommended for educational purposes or rapid prototyping. For serious research or production work, choose Tensorflow or PyTorch.
