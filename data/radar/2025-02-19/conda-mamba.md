Conda is the most widely used environment and package manager in the team, with varying levels of strictness in how it’s applied—ranging from simple environment.yml files for Jenkins builds to meticulous dependency management. The RDM team explicitly requested a shared Conda environment for consistent use across projects. However, with the rise of Pixi, Conda’s position might shift. If Pixi proves reliable and gains broader adoption, Conda could move to Hold.
