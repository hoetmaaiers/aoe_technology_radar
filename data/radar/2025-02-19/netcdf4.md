netCDF4 is a Python library for working with netCDF files, a standard format for storing multi-dimensional scientific data such as climate models, satellite observations, and oceanographic data. It provides efficient reading, writing, and manipulation of netCDF datasets. Widely used in research, it integrates well with NumPy and xarray, making it essential for handling large-scale structured data in scientific applications.
