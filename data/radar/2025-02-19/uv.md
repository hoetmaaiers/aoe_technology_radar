uv is an all-in-one tool for Python version management, package management, and lockfile handling. It offers a streamlined approach to managing environments and dependencies. It is (currently) limited by its lack of compatibility with Conda repositories, which can be tricky for some research projects. Very promising, but we're still evaluating this.
