cachetools is a Python library that provides in-memory caching with multiple eviction policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Time-To-Live (TTL). It’s useful for optimizing performance in scenarios where expensive function calls or frequent data retrievals can be cached. cachetools integrates easily with Python’s functools.lru_cache and offers more control over cache behavior, making it ideal for custom caching solutions.
