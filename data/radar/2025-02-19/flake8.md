flake8 is a linting tool that combines Pyflakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe for checking code style and complexity. While it has been a popular choice, it lacks the speed and broader functionality of newer tools like Ruff, which now covers most of flake8â€™s features with much better performance. For new projects, we recommend using Ruff instead. Even for existing projects, switching to Ruff is advised.
