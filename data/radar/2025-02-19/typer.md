Typer is a modern library for building command-line interfaces (CLI) in Python. Built on top of Click and inspired by FastAPI, it uses type hints to provide automatic validation, help messages, and autocompletion. It simplifies CLI development while maintaining clarity and scalability. Compared to argparse, Typer offers a more intuitive developer experience with less boilerplate code and better support for complex CLIs. It works especially well with Pydantic. Itâ€™s the preferred choice when building modern CLIs, especially if type safety, easy maintenance, and rich documentation are priorities.
