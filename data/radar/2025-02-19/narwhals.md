narwhals is a library that provides a unified API for working with both pandas and Polars data frames, offering an abstraction layer to switch between them seamlessly. While promising, it is still under development, and its long-term stability and adoption remain uncertain. Suitable for exploration but not yet recommended for widespread use.
