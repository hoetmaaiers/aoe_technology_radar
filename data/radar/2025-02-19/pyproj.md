pyproj is a library for cartographic projections and coordinate transformations. It is built on the PROJ library and is essential for working with geospatial data in different coordinate reference systems (CRS). While libraries like GeoPandas use pyproj internally, it remains useful for direct CRS transformations when fine-grained control is needed. It integrates well with other geospatial libraries such as Shapely and GeoPandas.
