TensorFlow is a comprehensive machine learning framework designed for both research and production, while Keras provides a high-level API for building models on top of TensorFlow. Keras simplifies model design with a more user-friendly interface, making it ideal for quick prototyping and small to medium-sized projects. For large-scale applications or performance-critical tasks, pure TensorFlow offers greater flexibility and control.

Use TensorFlow/Keras when you need scalability, integration with TensorFlow's ecosystem (e.g., TensorFlow Lite for mobile or TensorFlow Serving for deployment), or when working on deep learning in production. For more research-oriented projects, consider PyTorch.
