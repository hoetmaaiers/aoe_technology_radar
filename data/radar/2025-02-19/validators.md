validators is a lightweight Python library for validating the syntax of common objects like URLs, email addresses, IP addresses, and IBANs. It provides a simple and consistent API for performing basic validation checks. While itâ€™s useful for quick input validation, for more robust and customizable validation requirements, consider using specialized libraries such as Cerberus or pydantic.
