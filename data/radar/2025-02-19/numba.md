Numba is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for Python that can significantly speed up numerical computations by converting Python functions into optimized machine code. It works particularly well with NumPy arrays and loops, offering performance comparable to compiled languages like C. However, its effectiveness can vary depending on the use case—when it works, it’s great, but not all Python code can be easily optimized with Numba. It's worth experimenting with for performance-critical tasks.
