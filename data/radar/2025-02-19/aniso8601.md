aniso8601 is a Python library for parsing and formatting ISO 8601 date and time strings, which the standard datatime library is not capable of. It supports a wide range of ISO 8601 formats, including durations, intervals, and repeating intervals, making it useful for working with standardized date-time data. In research and data processing pipelines, it ensures consistent handling of temporal data across various systems.
