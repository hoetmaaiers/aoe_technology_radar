Pydantic is a Python library for data validation and settings management, built on type hints. It ensures runtime type enforcement and automatic data parsing, making it the preferred choice for API development (e.g., FastAPI). Compared to alternatives like marshmallow or Cerberus, Pydantic stands out for its performance and ease of use, especially in projects needing strict validation or typed settings (pydantic-settings).
