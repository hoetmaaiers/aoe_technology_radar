Plotly is a visualization library for creating interactive charts. It supports exporting charts as JSON, which can be rendered in the frontend using JavaScript. It is easy to use and supports a wide range of chart types, including geo data visualizations. While frontend teams primarily use Recharts, Plotly remains a good choice for Python-based applications requiring interactive visualizations.

We suggest to use plotly over matplotlib, seaborn and bokeh
