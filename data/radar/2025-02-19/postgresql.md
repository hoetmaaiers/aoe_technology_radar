PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database known for its reliability, scalability, and extensive feature set. It supports advanced features like full-text search, JSONB storage, and geospatial queries through PostGIS, making it versatile for a wide range of applications. PostgreSQL is preferred over MySQL for its stricter compliance with SQL standards, better concurrency handling, and advanced extensibility.
