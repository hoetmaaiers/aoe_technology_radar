xgboost is a powerful library for gradient boosting, widely used in machine learning for structured/tabular data. Known for its speed and accuracy, it supports regression, classification, and ranking tasks. It integrates well with scikit-learn and offers features like early stopping and tree pruning. For deep learning tasks, consider TensorFlow or PyTorch instead.
