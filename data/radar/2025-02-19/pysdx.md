pysdx is an internal VITO package built by Lorenz Hambsch for the analysis of spatial data with support for Postgis, with a ton of utility functions.
Although it's used by a lot of projects today, the code is outdated, no longer guaranteed to work and a lot of the functionality is available in geopandas by now.
Lorenz is planning a pysdx refresh. Until then, if you need pysdx functionality, check with Lorenz first; there may be simpler ways to achieve what you need.
