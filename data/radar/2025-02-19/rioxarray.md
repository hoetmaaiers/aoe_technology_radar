rioxarray extends xarray with geospatial capabilities, making it easier to work with raster data in Python. Built on rasterio, it supports reading, writing, and manipulating geospatial data with coordinate reference system (CRS) management. It integrates seamlessly with xarray, allowing for more efficient analysis of multi-dimensional geospatial datasets. rioxarray is the preferred tool for combining geospatial and scientific data workflows.
