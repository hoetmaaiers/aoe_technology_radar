parse is a Python library for parsing and extracting data from strings based on predefined patterns. In other words, it's a complement of str.format(). It offers a more readable and Pythonic alternative to regular expressions for simple string matching and extraction tasks. With its clean syntax and intuitive API, itâ€™s a useful tool for tasks like log parsing, configuration reading, and structured data extraction from text.
