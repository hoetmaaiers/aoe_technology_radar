PyTorch is the preferred framework for research and custom model development. Its dynamic computation graph and Pythonic interface make it easier to use, debug, and iterate compared to TensorFlow. PyTorch has become the dominant framework in academia and is increasingly adopted in industry for exploratory work and custom neural network design.
Use PyTorch when flexibility, ease of experimentation, and fast iteration are priorities. For large-scale production systems, TensorFlow may be a better fit due to its mature deployment tools.
