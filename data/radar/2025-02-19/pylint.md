Pylint is a static code analysis tool for Python, enforcing coding standards and detecting errors. While comprehensive, it can be overly strict and produce a high number of false positives, leading to frustration and reduced usability. With the adoption of Ruff for linting, which offers much faster performance and more practical rule sets, Pylint is no longer recommended for new projects. Even for existing projects, switching to Ruff is advised.
