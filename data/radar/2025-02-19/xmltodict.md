xmltodict is a Python library for converting XML data into easy-to-use Python dictionaries. It simplifies working with XML by avoiding the complexity of traditional XML parsers. This makes it ideal for quickly reading and processing XML data in projects where JSON-like access patterns are preferred. Itâ€™s particularly useful for configurations, APIs, and data exchange formats that rely on XML.
