Celery is a distributed task queue for handling asynchronous jobs and scheduling tasks in Python. Itâ€™s widely used for background task processing, such as sending emails, processing data, or integrating external services. Celery supports multiple message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis). Compared to lower-level solutions like pika, Celery simplifies task management with built-in retries, scheduling, and monitoring capabilities.
