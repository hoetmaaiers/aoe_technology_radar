toml is a package to parse TOML files: a human-readable configuration file format, commonly used for Python project settings (e.g., pyproject.toml). Also for basic configuration tasks, it's a powerful alternative to JSON or YAML. For more complex human-readable configuration, we suggest using YAML.
