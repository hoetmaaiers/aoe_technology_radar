pytest is the preferred testing framework for Python due to its simplicity and powerful features. It offers easy parameterization, flexible fixture management, and a rich command-line interface. pytest integrates well with CI/CD pipelines and supports plugins for features like code coverage reports. Compared to unittest, pytest is more concise and user-friendly, making it the better choice for most testing scenarios.
